### Instructions

Convert this grocery list app to read and write information to a PostgreSQL database instead of a TXT file.

### Getting Set Up

* Run `et get grocery-list-postgres`
* Install the necessary dependencies: `bundle`
* Create a database called `grocery_list_development`.
* Define your tables in a `schema.sql` file.
* Create tables by running `psql grocery_list_development < schema.sql` at the command line.
* Start the server: `ruby app.rb`

### Meeting Expectations Requirements
Acceptance tests have been written for you to build this grocery list app. Run the test suite with `rspec` and let the test errors guide your development and code implementation. Your first submission should satisfy the following requirements:

* Visiting `GET /groceries` should display the index page for groceries. This page should contain a list of groceries read from the database, as well as a form for adding a new grocery item.
* The name of each grocery item must be in [an `<li>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/li)
* The form to add a new grocery item requires that the name be specified.
* If the grocery item is left blank when the form is submitted...
  - A new grocery item record **should NOT** be saved to the database.
  - The user should see the index page for groceries.
* The form should submit to `POST /groceries`, which will save the new item to the database.
* Modify your Sinatra application so grocery items have comments. Modify your `schema.sql` file to create a new table for comments. Feel free to add a `DROP TABLES` line, so you can re-run your schema repeatedly.
* Create a `data.sql` file. Write SQL statements to insert a grocery item, as well as insert two or more comments for that grocery item in the `data.sql` file. Add these records to the database by running the following command: `psql grocery_list_development < data.sql`
* Clicking on a grocery item takes you to `GET /groceries/:id`.
* Visiting `GET /groceries/:id` should display the name of the grocery, a list of comments on the grocery.
* The list of comments **must** be retrieved using a SQL `JOIN` statement.
* All acceptance tests passing.

### Tips

* To meet expectations, all the requirements specified above must be met. It is possible to make all the tests pass, but not satisfy the requirements above, so please double-check the requirements once you are done.
* If your RSpec tests are failing, read the test files themselves closely. Make sure your schema names the table columns in the same way that the test is trying to read them.
* **DO NOT** start the requirements necessary to exceed expectations before completing the requirements necessary to meet expectations.

### Exceeds Expectations Requirements

* On the index page for groceries, add a button with the text "Delete" to the right of each list item.
* Clicking on the "Delete" button submits to `DELETE /groceries/:id`, which deletes the grocery item from the database.
* On the index page for groceries, add a link with the text "Update" to the right of each "Delete" link.
* Clicking on the "Update" link takes you to `GET /groceries/:id/edit`.
* Visiting `GET /groceries/:id/edit` displays a form pre-populated with the name of the grocery. The form submits to `PATCH /groceries/:id`, which updates the name of the item in the database.
* If the grocery item is left blank when the form is submitted...
  - The grocery item name **should NOT** be changed in the database.
  - The user should see the edit page for that grocery item.
* Write Capybara acceptance tests for this functionality.

### Tips

To have your form submit to the `DELETE` or `PATCH` routes in your Sinatra app, set the form method to `POST` and add a hidden input field, which has the `name` attribute set to `_method` and the `value` attribute set to the appropriate HTTP method.

```html
<form method="post" action="/">
  <input type="hidden" name="_method" value="HTTP METHOD HERE">
  #.. all of your form fields
</form>
```
